# Hypothesis-testing-one-sample-and-two-samples-the-QS

Implementing hypothesis testing on the QS data set in R
I used a data set called QS. The QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of global 
university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds. The Source of my data set is www.kaggle.com. 

in QS_ hypothesis_1 file, I implemented hypothesis testing one sample and two samples found that the mean 
of international students in the top 20 universities is greater than the theoretical mean of 5000 , 
mean of student_faculty ratio in the top 20 universities is less than the theoretical mean of 6 
international students in public universities is not equal to private universities in the top 20 
universities in 2017? 

in QS_ hypothesis_2, I want to answer the following questions by applying inferential statistics and 
hypothesis testing: 
 Does student_faculty_ratio effect on the rank of the university? 
 Does the faculty count effect on the number of international students at private and public 
 universities?
